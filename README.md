# CodeSnippetsNormalisation

For now this project conteins one command line tool code with the same name.

The tool tasks are:

- generating normalised shortcuts according to some known predefined rules (secific to my own naming convention),
- seting up this shortcut as the snippet file name,
- generating/updating a file `ListOfSnippets.md` listing all snippets
